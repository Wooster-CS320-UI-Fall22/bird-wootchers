# Interview Notes
In these notes, the abbreviation pkmn has been used to make it easier to trasncribe interviews. pkmn stands for Pokemon

## Interview 1: Ellie Stroke
### Part 1: Answers to Questions
1. When playing a pokemon game, how do you usually star building a team for it?
*I usually build my teams, the first run through, based on Pokemon that I like. And then, when I go through again, then I do a competitive Team*
Cont. So, do you usually plan out before you start playing what you're team would look like or do you just kind of go through the game and just pick the first few that you like the look of?
*I go based off of unique pkmn, and cool pkmn and like, the ones that I think look coolest the first run through.*
Cont. Just to confirm, is that that its first come first serve, where you play the game initially blind and you just pick the first ones you think look cool? Or before you even start do you ever plan out a team and only catch those Pokemon, or is that moreso for when you choose a competitive Team?
*I would say its half and half, because like, when I played the new game, i knew there were a couple that I wanted, so I went for those, but then theres open slots in my team that I fill with random Pkmn that I find.*

2. Mid-playthrough, do you ever decide to change a team member?
*Yeah, usually I leave the sixth spot open to account for like, gym leaders and type specifics.*
Cont. Has there ever been a time where you have had a core team member that you chose to switch out?
*Yeah*
Cont. What is usually your though process behind that sort of decision?
*Usually if his base stats are low and I see that he is not gonna grow anymore, I usually drop him. Get something with better stats.*

3. What information do you feel better understand what Pkmn to add to your team?
*I am very picky about the types I let on my team, there has to be a very wide range of types, advantages and disadvantages to cover across the board.*

4. When you do plan a team, how do you go about saving it?
*Well, in a lot of the pokemon games, you can have a battle box or you can have saved teams so thats usually how I save my teams.*
Cont. But you don't really do it outside the game?
*I never really write it down anywhere or anything*

5. Do you have much team building experience in pkmn.
*yes*

6. Have you ever used an external team building software for a pkmn game?
*not really, no*

7. When it comes to others players, how might we make the team building process easier for others?
*I would say, cuz it took me a long time to figure out all the pkmn, the stats. I went through a lot of research. Maybe dumbing it down and providing an optional tutorial for team buidling, like here are the good stats and bad natures and stuff? Becuase I never really had that base I kinda had to hope I was lucky.*
Cont. The scope of this software is going to be limited to the original games, which had much more simplified mechanics, and we will not be focusing much on the stats of the Pokemon. What insight could you provide on designing a software like that?
*I would say, you should teach the newer players the type mechanics and what types would be strong against others. How good your team would be against a specific type and stuff.*

### Part 2: Notes
Ellie seemed to have a lot of knowledge on building teams, at a much more advanced level than the scope of our current plan for the software. However, she did point out how initially, it was a bit confusing to try and learn all the type matchups as a new player. Furthemore, she did bring to light that usually, rather than planning out a team ahead of time, on first playthroughs she sometimes goes about the game blindly, and just chooses cool pkmn along the way. Designing our app to show the different stages a team goes through and how its strengths changes could be a good idea.


## Interview 2: Luke Henke
### Part 1: Answers to questions
1. How do you usually start building a team for a pkmn game?
*usually i try to get a good mix of types and good mix of movesets that can do a variety of attacks and status effects*
Cont. Does physical appearence matter much or is it more the competitive viability?
*Type and how viable it is is the most important, then after that, if there are some similar ones i'll go with the cooler looking one.*

2. After planning out a team, do you ever change it mid playthrough?
*Middle of a playthrough? yeah i'll swap something out if i know i'll need more of a certain type, and i'll cater my team to that. I usually have four or five that I will have planned to have added to the party, and then the last few will be more for situational or if theyve been in the party for a long time so they have sentimental value*

3. How do you usually go about changing team members, what usually goes through your mind?
*Usually it would just be swapping out one with a similar type that is better. Or just like if i need a tankier one to better round out the team*

4. What information do you think would better help you choose a pokemon for your team?
*Information on the moves, damage and accuracy stats. The type, and a way to tell the user what type is super effective against some types, what types arent.*

5. When you plan a team out, do you ever write it down to save it somewhere?
*I dont think ive written them down, but I'll kind of... i'll have an idea in my head and kind of memorize the plan, but i think thats pretty much it*

6. do you have much experience in team building?
*No its pretty much just playing a bunch of the games*

7. How might we make the team building process easier for others?
*Maybe a simplified way to view their stats, so you can tell what pkmn would be good for what*
Cont. Do you feel a way to view stats would be a requirement for a team builder?
*for it to be competitively viable, maybe? but if its just for like plannign out a team and playing with that team in the different games then i dont think it would be too necessary.*


### Part 2: Notes
Luke is also quite experiences with Pokemon games, and showed the persepctive of someone who mostly cares about competitive viability over aesthetics. He did show more interest in a team builder that would have a comprehensive list of stats for each pokemon. As both Ellie and Luke mentioned it, it may be worth considering adding it to our planner.

## Interview 3: Addison Walling
### Part 1: Answers to questions
1. How do you usually start buidling a team of Pkmn for a game?
*I chose the ones I like*
Cont. Could you elaborate a bit more?
*I just kinda be looking at them when I play the game and be like "yeah thats the one"*

2. While playing through a game, do you ever switch out team members?
*All the time, i be swapping them in and out all the time. If i wanna evolve a certain pkmn i go "yup you gotta go and you'll come back later"*

3. How do you go about changing team members? Is there much thought that goes into it?
*It just depends, if I am in an area where I can immediately recognise I need a type i'll probably put one or two more in, but mostly just try to evolve them to get that pokedex going*
Cont. So for you, has a large factor in team planning also been being able to complete the pokedex?
*a little bit, yeah. But also I just like having cool pokemon, and think that some would be a cool pokemon to have*

4. If you were to plan out a team, what information do you think would make it easier for you to do so?
*Types, stats in general, maybe a list of their names and a picture of them since I dont really remember them all by name, so maybe having a few pictures in there would be pretty helpful.*

5. Do you have any experience team building in pokemon?
*no I never do that.*

6. How might we make the team building process easier or more attractive for others?
*i think it would be helpful to have a team composition, so like is your team balanced against certain types and abilities, and if not then whatever. To make it easier for other people, just making it really easy to know what pokemon you want, by like filter list of just grass types. just something to make it helpful for someone who's not completely fluent in the pokemon database.*

### Part 2: Notes
Addison seemed a lot less experienced in team buidling than the other two interviewees, and did not seem to care about stats nearly as much as the others. His opinion for team building was largely driven by aesthetics, with a small focus put on types. He seemed to be the type who was very eager and happy to frequently swap out and change their team through a playthrough. He did provide great insight to tools we could provide less experienced pokemon fans to help them build a team.
