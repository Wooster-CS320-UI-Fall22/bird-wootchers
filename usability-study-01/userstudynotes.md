**Glenna**

Did not know much about Pokemon. No franchise experience at all. Has seen team builders for other games though.

User seems to confuse “quick add” button on Pokemon list for the default add pokemon button

Save button did not give any feedback, which confused the user. Fix this

Is a big pokemon fan, played black and white, pokemon go, and sword and shield. Has team building experience in clash royale.


Went to the “quick add” button instead of the normal adding route

Forgot to talk about “save team”, did not register

Went to “browse teams” instead of “manage teams” to find his gengar team

Wasn’t sure how to edit the team name
