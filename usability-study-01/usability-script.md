## Usability Script

Fantasy Pokemon League is a tool designed to make team building in the first generation of Pokémon games easier. It will allow you to view a full summary of each Pokémon, including their move list, evolution, stats, and types (including resistances and weaknesses). You will be able to plan out multiple teams, and be able to view overall team strength and weaknesses.

If you have any questions during today’s usability testing, please feel free to ask. You are encouraged to bring up any concerns or questions you have about the application. The screen and audio from this session will be recorded in order for us to better improve the application. Do you consent to being recorded?

**Pre-Test Questions:**

* Are you a big Pokemon fan?
* How long have you played any pokemon games, and which ones were they?
* Do you have any experience using team building tools of any sort, such as fantasy football, yugioh etc?

**Tasks:**

* You are a frequent user of the software, and want to log into your account. How would you go about this?
* How would you create a new team?
* You want to create a solo team of just Pikachu. Add Pikachu in the first slot of the new team and save the Team.
* You have a team already made of all Gengars, and you want to change the team members. Try to navigate to the team editing screen.
* You want to diversify the team. Edit the team by removing the first Gengar.
* You change your mind and want to add Gengar back. How would you go about this.
* You want to view other people’s teams. Navigate to the menu you think you would use to view other teams, and give the third team a positive review.
