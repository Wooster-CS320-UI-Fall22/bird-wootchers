# Debriefing Report

Overall, our usability testing was very affirming. While there were some small issues and some slight hiccups, overall, all of our subjects were able to navigate our demo with very little difficulty. One thing that was very encouraging was that this didn’t change despite the disparities in knowledge about the source material: One of our subjects had basically no familiarity with Pokemon, but they were able to navigate the site with basically the same ease as the subjects who were not familiar with the franchise. One potential blind spot in our testing was that we didn’t have any subjects who were unfamiliar with team building software in general. One limitation of the demo was the fact that the Figma project did not scale to the size of different desktops and does not include a built in scrollbar. This meant that in one instance, the “save” button was hidden in a way that it was completely unclear that it was there. This issue was the result of the Figma prototype, and would be fixed by using actual web pages with built in scrollbars. However, overall, all subjects completed their tasks well.

## Ranked issues
* "Menu" button ambiguous. On the team builder page, it can be read not as “main menu” but as “options”.
* Differentiating between Browse teams to view others and manage teams to view the user’s own teams was unclear.
* No feedback when the save button is hit.
* “Quick add” button on pokemon list being confused as the default add button, should make it clearer.
* Way to edit team name unclear.

## Brief Resolution Plan
* Change “menu” to either main menu or “back”
* Change the browse teams and manage team button names to make it clearer
* Add either a pop-up or a sound to let user know when the team has been saved
* Change quick add button from an ambiguous “+” to “Quick Add”
